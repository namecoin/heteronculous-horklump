## DEMO
Assume you are running the SOCKS5 proxy with the default IP address: "localhost:9050". Trace for proxy leaks and Socksify your connecitons by running:
```
./tracer -horklump.program wget -horklump.args https://116.202.120.121 
-horklump.args --no-check-certificate -horklump.args 
--header=Host:check.torproject.org 
```
Since the default address is `localhost:9050` there is no need to set it.

Assume you are running the tor HTTP proxy with the default IP address: "localhost:9080". Trace for proxy leaks and Socksify your connecitons by running:
```
./tracer -horklump.program wget -horklump.redirect http -horklump.sockstcp 
127.0.0.1:9080 -horklump.args https://116.202.120.121 -horklump.args 
--no-check-certificate -horklump.args --header=Host:check.torproject.org 
```
